RISC-V assembly:

Registers a0, a1, ... stores arguments to functions. e.g. 13 is stored in register a2 in main's call to printf.

No direct call instruction for calling f in main. The compiler has already precalculated the result. There is also no direct call to g, as the compiler has inlined that function call.

Printf is located at 0x630.

Register ra will be 0x38.

The output is: "HE110 World". I would need to set i to 0x726c6400 if RISC-V were big-endian. I would not need to change 57616.
The answer depends on what register a2 is at that time. The reason is that there are no enough arguments passed to printf.
