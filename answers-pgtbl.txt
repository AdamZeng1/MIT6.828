Explain the output of vmprint in terms of Fig 3-4 from the text. What does page 0 contain? What is in page 2? When running in user mode, could the process read/write the memory mapped by page 1?

Text.

Explain why the third test srcva + len < srcva is necessary in copyin_new(): give values for srcva and len for which the first two test fail (i.e., they will not cause to return -1) but for which the third one is true (resulting in returning -1).


Overflow problems.


Additional:

Q: What does it mean by "it's OK to map over CLINT"?
A: Just do not map CLINT in function proc_kpgtbl() :)

Q: What permissions do the PTEs for user addresses need in a process's kernel page table?
A: We should never set PTE_U. Because when we do copyin, we need to access user data in kernel mode.
